<!-- 
---------------vh and vw---------------
 If we set height of a div using 100%, it will take the % value based on its parent div's height, 
 but if set it using 100vh, it will take the height w.r.t the viewport height
 
 100vh - 100% of viewport height
 100vw - 100% of viewport width

 Similarly, if we set width of a div using 100%, it will take the % value based on its parent div's width, 
 but if set it using 100vw, it will take the width w.r.t the viewport viewport width

 -------------vmin and vmax------------
 If we set font-size of a text using 8vmin, it will take the minimum value of the viewport height and viewport width and 8% of it.
 If we set font-size of a text using 8vmax, it will take the maximum value of the viewport height and viewport width and 8% of it.
